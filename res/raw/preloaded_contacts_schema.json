  This is the documentation for the file that can be created as
  res/raw/preloaded_contacts.json .

  This file encodes the contact information that must be preloaded into
  the contacts database. The contact information is encoded according
  to the schema outlined below.

  The top-level object is an array of 'contacts'. Each of the array elements
  is a contact with an array called 'data' defined within. Each of the objects
  within 'data' objects describe an aspect of the contact - name, phone number,
  address etc. Each aspect becomes a row in the raw_contacts table within
  the contacts database. 

  When describing a property for a contact aspect, the keys and values can
  reference java fields. These fields will be resolved at runtime. This enables
  us to leverage the fields defined in android.provider.ContactsContract.* classes
  to describe the contact information.

  Note that if any java fields are referenced, they must be fully qualified names
  as seen from a ClassLoader's perspective. There is no validation done to ensure
  that the fields names can be resolved till runtime.

  Conveniences afforded while declaring contact information :
    @ = android.provider.ContactsContract$CommonDataKinds
    @mimetype = android.provider.ContactsContract$Data.MIMETYPE

  Example :
    {
      "contacts": [
        {
          "data": [
            {
              "@mimetype": "{{@$StructuredName.CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE}}",
              "@$StructuredName.DISPLAY_NAME": "John Doe"
            },

            {
              "@mimetype": "{{@$Phone.CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE}}",
              "@$Phone.NUMBER": "123-456-7890",
              "@$Phone.TYPE": "{{@$Phone.TYPE_WORK}}"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

  Property values can be static values or expressions that need to be evaluated, like
  the property keys. Values are interpolated when enclosed within
  double-curly-braces - '{{' - akin to a templating system like Handlebars.

  Limitations :
    - currently, for property values, there is no provision to embed an 
      expression-to-be-evaluated, within a larger string
        ex. "{{com.example.foo.BAR}} additional content" isn't valid

    - lack of compile time validation of the java fields specified or of the syntax

    - lack of compile time validation of the property keys' with-respect-to the
      columns of the raw_contacts table
